# In concentrations up to 1% (10,000 ppm), it will make some people feel drowsy and
# give the lungs a stuffy feeling.[90] Concentrations of 7% to 10% (70,000 to 
# 100,000 ppm) may cause suffocation, even in the presence of sufficient oxygen, 
# manifesting as dizziness, headache, visual and hearing dysfunction, and 
# unconsciousness within a few minutes to an hour.[92] The physiological effects 
# of acute carbon dioxide exposure are grouped together under the term hypercapnia, 
# a subset of asphyxiation.

# In an average resting adult, the lungs take up about 250ml of oxygen every minute
# while excreting about 200ml of carbon dioxide.
